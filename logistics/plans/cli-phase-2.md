Now let me analyze the CLI flow more carefully. Let me look at the specific syntax error area:

Read file: src/cli.ts
Perfect! Now I have a clear picture of the issues. Let me create a comprehensive plan to fix the CLI from the root:

## **Big Picture Analysis & Fixing Plan**

### **Current Issues Identified:**

1. **Critical Syntax Errors:**
   - Line 449: Double `return` statements
   - Line 450: `handleInput` function ends prematurely, leaving code orphaned
   - Incorrect nesting of try-catch-finally blocks 
   - Missing closing braces and incorrect scope

2. **Architectural Issues:**
   - Complex nested async handlers with raw mode switching
   - Overly complicated input loop logic  
   - Mixed responsibilities (input handling, error management, UI formatting)
   - Inconsistent state management for abort controllers

3. **Code Structure Problems:**
   - CLI logic is overly complex and hard to follow
   - Too many responsibilities in the main function
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns

### **Root Cause:**
The CLI was likely incrementally modified with features (ESC key handling, raw mode, abort controller) without proper refactoring, leading to broken control flow.

## **Comprehensive Fix Plan:**

### **Phase 1: Structure & Separation of Concerns**
1. **Create a dedicated CLI class** to encapsulate all CLI logic
2. **Separate input handling** from the main initialization 
3. **Create dedicated modules** for:
   - Input/Output management
   - Signal handling (ESC, Ctrl+C)
   - Agent interaction
   - State management

### **Phase 2: Simplify the Flow**
1. **Remove raw mode complexity** - this seems unnecessary and error-prone
2. **Simplify the input loop** using readline interface properly
3. **Clean up abort controller logic** - make it more straightforward
4. **Fix the try-catch-finally nesting**

### **Phase 3: Fix Syntax & Logic**
1. **Fix the broken handleInput function** structure
2. **Remove duplicate returns and orphaned code**
3. **Ensure proper error propagation**
4. **Test the basic CLI flow works**

### **Phase 4: Enhance & Polish**
1. **Add proper TypeScript types** throughout
2. **Improve error messages** and user experience
3. **Add comprehensive testing** for CLI flows
4. **Documentation** for the CLI architecture

### **Immediate Action:**
Would you like me to start with **Phase 2 & 3** (simplify and fix syntax first) to get a working CLI, then refactor for better structure? Or do you prefer to start with **Phase 1** (full restructure) for a cleaner long-term solution?

The current CLI has good ideas (ESC cancellation, trace output, tool presets) but the implementation is tangled. A working-first approach vs. clean-architecture-first approach - what's your preference?

# Implementing True ReAct Pattern in TinyAgent-TS

## Current Limitations

While TinyAgent-TS currently has some of the foundations needed for a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent, the implementation doesn't fully adhere to the ReAct pattern as defined in academic literature. Here are the key limitations:

1. **Missing Explicit Reasoning Step**: The current agent doesn't explicitly separate and expose its reasoning process before taking actions. In a true ReAct implementation, the agent should articulate its thought process before deciding on a tool to use.

2. **No Structured Observation Format**: The current implementation doesn't have a structured way to process and represent observations from tool calls. Tool results are simply appended to the conversation history as "TOOL_RESULT: {...}".

3. **Implicit Action Selection**: The agent implicitly selects actions by parsing JSON from the LLM output, but doesn't follow a formalized ReAct structure where action selection is an explicit step.

4. **Limited Debugging and Transparency**: The current implementation doesn't provide clear visibility into the agent's reasoning chain, making it difficult to debug and understand why certain tools were selected.

5. **No Scratchpad Concept**: ReAct typically employs a "scratchpad" where the agent writes its thoughts, actions, and observations. The current framework doesn't explicitly implement this concept.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core ReAct Structure

1. **Design ReAct Prompt Template**:
   - Create a structured prompt template that explicitly guides the LLM through the Thought→Action→Observation cycle
   - Implement proper formatting for each step in the cycle

2. **Implement Structured Reasoning**:
   - Modify the agent class to extract and store the agent's reasoning as a separate step
   - Add a `Thought` class/interface to represent reasoning steps

3. **Add Formal Action Structure**:
   - Refine the current tool call mechanism into a more structured `Action` class/interface
   - Implement validation for action schema

4. **Create Observation Structure**:
   - Implement an `Observation` class/interface to standardize tool outputs
   - Add formatting utilities for presenting observations back to the LLM

### Phase 2: Scratchpad Implementation

1. **Implement Scratchpad Mechanism**:
   - Add a Scratchpad class to track the sequence of Thought-Action-Observation
   - Implement methods for appending to and retrieving from the scratchpad

2. **Integrate Scratchpad with Prompt Engine**:
   - Modify the prompt engine to incorporate the scratchpad history
   - Ensure proper formatting of the scratchpad within system and user messages

### Phase 3: Enhanced Debugging and Transparency

1. **Add Tracing Capabilities**:
   - Implement a tracing system to log each step of the ReAct process
   - Create visualizations for the agent's reasoning chain

2. **Implement Step-by-Step Execution Option**:
   - Add the ability to run the agent in a step-by-step mode
   - Create hooks for inspecting the agent's state between steps

### Phase 4: Examples and Documentation

1. **Create Detailed ReAct Examples**:
   - Implement a comprehensive example showing multi-step reasoning
   - Add examples demonstrating common ReAct patterns and techniques

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document the ReAct implementation and best practices
   - Create tutorials for implementing custom ReAct agents

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these changes, TinyAgent-TS will provide:

1. A true ReAct implementation with explicit Thought-Action-Observation cycles
2. Better visibility into the agent's reasoning process
3. Improved debugging capabilities
4. A more structured approach to building complex reasoning agents
5. Examples demonstrating how to leverage the ReAct pattern for complex tasks

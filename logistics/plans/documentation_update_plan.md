# Documentation Update Plan for tinyagent-ts

## Overview

This plan outlines a comprehensive update to the tinyagent-ts documentation to better showcase its features, capabilities, and provide clearer guidance for users. Based on an analysis of the codebase and examples, the current documentation provides a good foundation but can be enhanced to cover more use cases and implementation details.

## Current State

- The README.md provides a high-level overview of the framework's structure and basic operation
- There's limited documentation on the `/examples` directory which contains several valuable implementation patterns
- The advanced features of the framework (ReAct pattern, multi-step agents, etc.) are mentioned but not thoroughly explained
- Users may struggle to understand how to implement certain patterns or use specific agent types

## Goals

1. Make the documentation more comprehensive while maintaining clarity
2. Provide detailed explanations of each example in the `/examples` directory
3. Create step-by-step guides for common implementation patterns
4. Improve the onboarding experience for new users
5. Document advanced features and customization options

## Action Items

### 1. Enhance the Main README.md

- Update the project structure section to reflect the current state of the codebase
- Expand the Quick Start section with more thorough instructions
- Add a section specifically about the examples directory with brief descriptions of each example
- Improve the explanation of the ReAct implementation
- Add a "Concepts" section explaining key terminology and patterns

### 2. Create an Examples Directory README

Create a dedicated README.md in the `/examples` directory with:

- Overview of each example's purpose and features
- Instructions for running each example
- Output samples showing what to expect
- Brief explanations of the key concepts demonstrated

### 3. Create Individual Example Documentation

For each example in the `/examples` directory, create a dedicated markdown file with:

- Detailed explanation of what the example demonstrates
- Step-by-step breakdown of the code
- Instructions for customization
- Use cases and practical applications

### 4. Create Advanced Usage Guide

Create a new document that covers:

- Custom tool creation patterns
- Working with different LLM providers
- Implementing the ReAct pattern
- Creating multi-step agents
- Error handling and debugging
- Performance optimization

### 5. Create API Reference

Develop a comprehensive API reference that documents:

- Core classes (`Agent`, `MultiStepAgent`, etc.)
- Decorators (`@model`, `@tool`)
- Utility functions and classes
- Configuration options

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: README.md Update

1. Restructure the main README.md to include sections for all key concepts
2. Update project structure to reflect current state
3. Expand Quick Start with clearer instructions
4. Add section on examples with brief descriptions

### Phase 2: Examples Documentation

1. Create `/examples/README.md` with overview of all examples
2. Create individual markdown files for each example:
   - `/examples/docs/math-agent.md`
   - `/examples/docs/react-calculator.md`
   - `/examples/docs/react.md`
   - `/examples/docs/todo-agent.md`
   - `/examples/docs/web-search.md`
   - `/examples/docs/wiki-summary.md`

### Phase 3: Advanced Documentation

1. Create `/docs` directory for extended documentation
2. Create `/docs/advanced-usage.md`
3. Create `/docs/api-reference.md`
4. Create `/docs/customization.md`

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week

## Success Metrics

- Reduced number of basic usage questions from new users
- Increased adoption of advanced features
- Positive feedback from the community
- More diverse examples contributed by the community

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan with the team
2. Prioritize documentation updates based on user needs
3. Assign responsibilities for each documentation component
4. Establish a review process for documentation changes

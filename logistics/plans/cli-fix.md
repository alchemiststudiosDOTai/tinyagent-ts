Certainly! Hereâ€™s a clear **PLAN.md** for your dev team, broken into three focused phases for implementing and improving centralized error handling in your CLI project.

# PLAN.md

## Centralized Error Handling Implementation

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Integration**

**Goal:**  
Establish a robust, centralized error handling mechanism for the CLI.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Define a custom `CLIError` class for known CLI errors.
- [x] Implement a `handleError` function to process all error types.
- [x] Integrate `handleError` with `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')`.
- [x] Use `chalk` for colored error output.
- [x] Add support for debug stack traces via `process.env.DEBUG`.

**Deliverables:**
- `CLIError` class in a dedicated file (e.g., `errors.ts`).
- `handleError` function in a utilities or core file.
- Error handling hooks in the CLI entry point.

---

### **Phase 2: Adoption & Consistency**

**Goal:**  
Ensure all CLI modules and commands use the centralized error handling.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Refactor all command modules to throw `CLIError` for expected errors.
- [x] Replace ad-hoc `console.error` and `process.exit` calls with error throwing.
- [x] Document error codes and messages for common failure scenarios.
- [x] Add unit tests for error handling logic and edge cases.

**Deliverables:**
- Consistent error handling across all CLI commands.
- Error documentation (e.g., `ERRORS.md`).
- Test coverage for error scenarios.

**Review after each phase** to ensure goals are met and adjust the plan as needed.

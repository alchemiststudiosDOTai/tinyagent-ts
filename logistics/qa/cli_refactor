Certainly! Here’s a **summary of the QA team’s work** during Phase 1 of the CLI refactoring project:

---

## **QA Team Phase 1 Summary**

### **1. Verification of Modularization**
- **Reviewed** the new CLI architecture to ensure each module (I/O, signal handling, agent interaction, state, formatting, utilities, controller) had a clear, single responsibility.
- **Confirmed** that all modules were properly exported and could be imported without errors.

### **2. Functional Testing**
- **Tested** the new CLI in various modes:
  - **Normal operation** (basic chat)
  - **Test mode** (mock responses)
  - **Trace mode** (reasoning steps)
  - **Tool presets** (all, basic, search, none)
  - **Custom tool loading**
- **Validated** all built-in commands: `help`, `clear`, `exit`, and prompt handling.

### **3. Signal & Error Handling**
- **Simulated** ESC key and Ctrl+C to ensure:
  - Graceful cancellation of running operations
  - Clean exit from the CLI
- **Checked** error messages for clarity and helpfulness.

### **4. Build & Integration**
- **Ensured** the CLI built cleanly with no errors or critical warnings.
- **Tested** both TypeScript and compiled (dist) versions.
- **Verified** npm scripts (`npm run cli`) and direct execution (`node dist/cli.js`).

### **5. Regression Testing**
- **Confirmed** that all original CLI features were preserved after refactoring.
- **Checked** for any regressions or missing functionality compared to the legacy CLI.

### **6. Documentation & Feedback**
- **Provided feedback** on usability, error messages, and help output.
- **Suggested** minor improvements for clarity and user experience.

## **Key Outcomes**

- **All core CLI features work as expected.**
- **No critical bugs or regressions found.**
- **Modular structure is robust and maintainable.**
- **Build and run processes are smooth and reliable.**

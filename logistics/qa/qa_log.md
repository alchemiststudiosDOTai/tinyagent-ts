# QA Log and Plan

**Date:** 2025-05-12

## QA Process Overview

After completing each major refactoring phase (as defined in [`logistics/plans/refactor_typescript_agent_framework.md`](logistics/plans/refactor_typescript_agent_framework.md)), we will perform the following QA steps:

1.  **Run Baseline Tests:** Execute the established baseline test scripts to ensure core functionality remains intact.
2.  **Manual Checks (Optional):** Perform manual checks or run examples if specific changes warrant closer inspection.
3.  **Log Results:** Document the results of the tests (pass/fail) and any observations in this log file.
4.  **Update Tests (If Necessary):** If the refactoring changes the expected behavior or structure, update the baseline tests accordingly for the next phase.

## Phase 1 Completion QA (Baseline Establishment)

**Objective:** Establish a working baseline test for the `MultiplierAgent` example after Phase 1 (Setup & Basic TypeScript Enhancements) completion.

**Test Script:** [`test/multiplierAgent.test.ts`](test/multiplierAgent.test.ts)

**Test Description:**

- The script initializes the `MultiplierAgent`.
- It sends a specific question ("What is 12 multiplied by 5? Use your tool.") to the agent's `run` method.
- It checks if the agent's final response string contains the expected numerical result ("60").
- The test logs PASS or FAIL to the console and exits with code 0 for pass and 1 for fail.

**Execution Command:** `npx ts-node test/multiplierAgent.test.ts`

**Next Steps:**

- Run the baseline test command (`npx ts-node test/multiplierAgent.test.ts`).
- Record the results below.
- Proceed to Phase 2 refactoring.

**Phase 1 QA Test Results (2025-05-12):**

- **Command Executed:** `npx ts-node test/multiplierAgent.test.ts`
- **Output:**
  ```
  --- Running MultiplierAgent Baseline Test ---
  ‚ùì Question: "What is 12 multiplied by 5? Use your tool."
  ’°’Ø Expected result substring: "60"
  MultiplierAgent: Called multiply tool with a=12, b=5
  ü§ñ Agent Raw Answer: "The final answer is 60."
  ‚úÖ TEST PASSED: Agent answer contains "60".
  --- MultiplierAgent Baseline Test Finished ---
  ```
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Observations:** The agent correctly used the `multiply` tool and the LLM (qwen/qwen2-72b-instruct, as per your last update) successfully processed the tool's output to provide the correct final answer. The test script's assertion passed.

**Phase 2 QA Test Results (2025-05-12):**

- **Command Executed:** `npx ts-node test/promptEngine.test.ts`
- **Output:**
  ```
  (See terminal log)
  ```
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Observations:** All prompt engine scenarios executed successfully, verifying
  default templates, overrides, registration, overwrite behavior and error
  messages. The default template object remained unchanged.

---

**Phase 3 QA Test Results (2025-05-12):**

- **Command Executed:** `npx ts-node test/promptEngine.test.ts`
- **Output:**
  ```
  (See terminal log)
  ```
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Observations:** New prompt loader functions handled markdown files from
  `src/core/prompts/system` without mutating built-ins.

# ReAct Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the issues we encountered with the ReAct implementation in TinyAgent-TS and the fixes we applied to make it work correctly.

## What is ReAct?

ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) is a pattern for AI agents that combines reasoning and acting in a loop:

1. **Thought**: The agent reasons about what to do next
2. **Action**: The agent takes an action (usually calling a tool)
3. **Observation**: The agent observes the result of the action

This cycle repeats until the agent reaches a final answer.

## Issues Encountered

1. **Access Modifiers**: The `MultiStepAgent` class couldn't access private methods from the base `Agent` class.
2. **Type Errors**: Missing `getSteps()` method in the `Scratchpad` class.
3. **String Literal Errors**: Syntax issues in the console.log statements in react.ts.
4. **JSON Parsing Issues**: The `parseThoughtAction` function wasn't properly handling JSON tool calls.
5. **Unclear Prompting**: The system prompt for ReAct wasn't explicit enough about using JSON format.
6. **Final Answer Handling**: The final answer was displayed as "[object Object]" instead of the actual content.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Changed Access Modifiers

Changed the following methods in the `Agent` class from `private` to `protected` so they can be accessed by derived classes:

```typescript
protected getModelName(): string
protected buildToolRegistry(): Record<string, ToolHandle>
protected readonly customSystemPrompt?: string
protected async makeOpenRouterRequest(...)
```

### 2. Added getSteps() Method

Added the `getSteps()` method to the `Scratchpad` class:

```typescript
/**
 * Get all steps in the scratchpad
 * @returns Array of all steps
 */
getSteps(): ScratchStep[] {
  return [...this.steps];
}
```

### 3. Fixed String Literal Syntax

Fixed string literal syntax errors in the react.ts example by properly terminating string literals and removing newlines.

### 4. Improved JSON Parsing

Enhanced the `parseThoughtAction` function to better handle JSON tool calls by:
- Checking if the text starts with '{' and ends with '}'
- Adding a regex pattern to extract JSON from text
- Prioritizing JSON parsing before code block detection

### 5. Updated ReAct System Prompt

Made the ReAct system prompt more explicit about using JSON format for actions:

```markdown
You are a tool-using assistant that follows the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern. Your goal is to solve tasks by thinking step-by-step and using tools when necessary.

Available tools:
{{tools}}

You MUST respond using ONLY the following format for each step in your reasoning:

Thought: <your detailed reasoning about what to do next>
Action: {"tool":"tool_name","args":{"param1":"value1", "param2":"value2"}}

The Action MUST be valid JSON with exactly two fields: 'tool' (string) and 'args' (object).

After each tool returns an observation, continue the cycle of Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation until you're ready to provide a final answer.

When you're ready to give the final answer, use the 'final_answer' tool:

Thought: <your reasoning about the final answer>
Action: {"tool":"final_answer","args":{"answer":"your final answer here"}}

NEVER use code blocks. ALWAYS use the JSON format for actions.
```

### 6. Fixed Final Answer Handling

Modified the `MultiStepAgent` class to properly extract and return the answer content from the final_answer tool:

```typescript
if (action.tool === finalTool.name) {
  const finalAnswer = await finalTool.forward(action.args);
  observation = typeof finalAnswer === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(finalAnswer) : String(finalAnswer);
  this.scratchpad.addObservation(observation);
  this.log(undefined, undefined, observation);
  if (this.onStep) this.onStep(this.scratchpad);
  return action.args.answer as unknown as O;
}
```

## Results

After applying these fixes, the ReAct example now works correctly. The agent successfully:

1. Follows the Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation loop
2. Uses JSON tool calls correctly
3. Returns the final answer in the proper format

Example output:

```
üß† Running ReAct Agent Demo...
‚ùì Query: "Calculate 23 * 17 and then echo the result with a friendly message."
T: First, I need to calculate the product of 23 and 17. | A: calculate
O: "Result: 391"
üëÅÔ∏è  Observation: "Result: 391"
T: Now, I will echo the result with a friendly message. | A: echo
O: "Echo: The product of 23 and 17 is 391. Hope that helps!"
üëÅÔ∏è  Observation: "Echo: The product of 23 and 17 is 391. Hope that helps!"
T: I have completed the calculation and echoed the result with a friendly message. | A: final_answer
O: {"answer":"The product of 23 and 17 is 391. Hope that helps!"}
üëÅÔ∏è  Observation: {"answer":"The product of 23 and 17 is 391. Hope that helps!"}
‚úÖ Final Answer: The product of 23 and 17 is 391. Hope that helps!
```

## Conclusion

The TinyAgent-TS framework now correctly implements the ReAct pattern, allowing agents to reason through multi-step problems by maintaining a scratchpad of thoughts, actions, and observations. This implementation demonstrates how the framework can be used to build AI agents that can solve complex tasks requiring multiple steps and tool calls.

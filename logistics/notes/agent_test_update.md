# MultiplierAgent Test Update Notes

## Summary
We updated the test for `MultiplierAgent` to improve coverage and usability, and made it easier to run via npm scripts.

## Steps Taken

1. **Reviewed Existing Test and Agent Implementation**
   - Examined `test/multiplierAgent.test.ts` and `src/multiplierAgent.ts` to understand the current logic and structure.

2. **Enhanced the Test**
   - Modified `test/multiplierAgent.test.ts` to:
     - Run multiple multiplication questions (not just one).
     - Check that the agent's answer contains the correct product for each question.
     - Print clear output for each test case, including pass/fail status and a summary.
     - Handle errors gracefully and print them.

3. **Example Questions Used**
   - "What is 12 multiplied by 5?" (expect "60")
   - "What is 7 times 8?" (expect "56")
   - "Multiply 0 by 99." (expect "0")
   - "What is 100 times 1?" (expect "100")

4. **Added npm Test Script**
   - Updated `package.json` to include:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "test": "ts-node test/multiplierAgent.test.ts"
     }
     ```
   - This allows running the test with `npm test`.

5. **How to Run the Test**
   - Ensure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Ensure `.env` contains a valid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
   - Run the test: `npm test`

## Troubleshooting
- If a test fails or the agent returns an empty answer, check your API key, rate limits, and network connection.
- Review the console output for error messages and debugging information.

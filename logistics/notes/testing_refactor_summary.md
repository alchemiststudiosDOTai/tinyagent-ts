# Testing Refactor & Cleanup Summary (May 2025)

## Overview
We migrated the codebase's test strategy from standalone Node scripts to modern, maintainable Jest-based test suites. The goals were:
- **CI-friendliness**
- **Deterministic, mockable tests**
- **Clear assertion/reporting**
- **TypeScript best practices**

## Key Steps

### 1. MultiplierAgent Tests
- Rewrote `test/multiplierAgent.test.ts` as a Jest test suite (`describe`/`it`/`expect`).
- Added type-safe, immutable test cases (including edge cases: negatives, floats, malformed input).
- Mocked LLM calls by default for CI; real calls only if `RUN_LIVE` is set.
- Removed all manual `console.log`/`process.exit` for pass/fail.

### 2. PromptEngine Tests
- Converted from a custom assertion script to a Jest suite.
- Used Jest's global test functions (no imports needed).
- Fixed a file-based override test to allow for multi-line template rendering.

### 3. FinalAnswerTool Tests
- Migrated from a Node script to a Jest suite.
- Used `it.each` for a variety of payloads (string, number, object, array, null, undefined).
- Ensured the tool echoes all payloads exactly as received.

### 4. Project/Jest Setup
- Added `jest`, `ts-jest`, and `@types/jest` as dev dependencies (v29.x for compatibility).
- Added `jest.config.js` for TypeScript and dotenv integration.
- Updated `tsconfig.json` for Jest type support in tests.
- Added scripts: `npm test` (mocked), `npm run test:live` (real LLM).

### 5. General Cleanup
- Removed all Vitest imports (using Jest's globals instead).
- Cleaned up and committed all test and config changes.

## Result
- All tests now run and pass under Jest.
- Tests are CI-ready, deterministic by default, and support live integration if needed.
- Codebase is easier to maintain and extend for future contributors.

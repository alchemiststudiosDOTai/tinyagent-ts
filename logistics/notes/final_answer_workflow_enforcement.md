# Final Answer Workflow Enforcement

**Date**: 2025-05-21

## Overview

This document details the changes made to properly enforce the `final_answer` workflow in the TinyAgent-TS framework. We updated the codebase to ensure all agents must use the `final_answer` tool to provide their final response rather than returning direct answers or using a generic `FINISH` tool.

## Background

Previously, the framework had inconsistent handling of final answers across different agent types:

1. Some agents allowed direct `answer` objects to be returned
2. Some used a `FINISH` tool without proper type safety
3. The schema validation for responses was inconsistent
4. Examples weren't consistently using the `final_answer` pattern

This led to inconsistent behavior and type errors in the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Fixes in MultiStepAgent

We encountered TypeScript errors where the arguments passed to `finalTool.forward()` didn't match the expected `FinalAnswerInput` type:

```typescript
// Error:
src/multiStepAgent.ts:82:57 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'Record<string, unknown>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'FinalAnswerInput'.
  Property 'answer' is missing in type 'Record<string, unknown>' but required in type 'FinalAnswerInput'.
```

Fixes:

```typescript
// Changed from:
const finalAnswer = await finalTool.forward(action.args);

// To:
const finalAnswerArgs = { answer: action.args.answer as string };
const finalAnswer = await finalTool.forward(finalAnswerArgs);
```

This ensures type safety while preserving the argument's content.

### 2. Example File Updates

All example files were updated to properly handle the new return format from `agent.run()`, which now returns an object with an `answer` property:

```typescript
// Before:
const answer = await agent.run(question);
console.log(`✅ Answer: ${answer}`);

// After:
const result = await agent.run(question);
const answer = typeof result === 'object' && result && 'answer' in result
  ? (result as { answer: string }).answer
  : String(result);
console.log(`✅ Answer: ${answer}`);
```

Modified files:
- `math.ts`
- `react.ts`
- `multiplierAgent.ts`
- `onecall.ts`
- `web-search.ts`

### 3. System Prompt Improvements

The system prompt was significantly enhanced to force the LLM to use the `final_answer` tool correctly. Changes included:

#### a. Basic Tool Call Pattern

```markdown
EVERY reply MUST be a valid JSON object calling ONE of these tools.
For example: {"tool": "toolName", "args": {"argName": "value"}}

When the task is complete, you MUST finish with the `final_answer` tool using:
{"tool": "final_answer", "args": {"answer": "Your final answer text here"}}
```

#### b. Explicit Tool Usage Examples

```markdown
# Tool Usage Examples

To call the add tool:
{"tool": "add", "args": {"a": 2, "b": 3}}

To call the multiply tool:
{"tool": "multiply", "args": {"a": 4, "b": 5}}

To finish:
{"tool": "final_answer", "args": {"answer": "The result is 20"}}
```

#### c. Multi-Step Example

```markdown
# Multi-Step Tool Usage Example

Suppose the user asks: "What is 2 + 3, then multiply the result by 4?"

Step 1: Call the add tool:
{"tool": "add", "args": {"a": 2, "b": 3}}

Step 2: Take the result (5) and call the multiply tool:
{"tool": "multiply", "args": {"a": 5, "b": 4}}

Step 3: Finish with the final_answer tool:
{"tool": "final_answer", "args": {"answer": "The result is 20"}}
```

#### d. Negative/Positive Examples

```markdown
# Important

❌ Do NOT return a direct answer or a JSON object like {"result": 50}.
✅ You MUST always finish with: {"tool": "final_answer", "args": {"answer": "The result is 50"}}
```

### 4. New Demo Example

Created a new `final-answer-demo.ts` example that demonstrates the proper use of the `final_answer` tool.

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. LLM Tool Call Behavior

Even with improved prompting, we encountered several challenges with LLM behavior:

1. **Incorrect Argument Passing**: The LLM initially failed to pass required arguments to tools (`Invalid arguments for tool "add": a: Required, b: Required`)

2. **Format Inconsistency**: The LLM would sometimes return direct JSON objects like `{"result": 50}` instead of using the `final_answer` tool

3. **Incomplete Tool Chains**: For multi-step problems, the LLM sometimes wouldn't complete the full chain, stopping after the first tool call

### 2. TypeScript Type System Constraints

1. We had to use explicit type casting (`as string`) to satisfy TypeScript in places where we knew the structure was correct but the type system couldn't verify it

2. Return types had to be adjusted to use `any` in some places where we couldn't precisely model the return structure

### 3. Backward Compatibility

Maintaining backward compatibility while enforcing the new pattern required adding fallback logic to handle responses that might not match the expected format.

## Further Improvements

### 1. Consider Adding Middleware for Tool Calls

A middleware layer could validate and transform tool calls before execution, ensuring arguments match the expected types.

### 2. Stricter Type Definitions

Instead of using `any` or generic `Record<string, unknown>` types, create more specific interfaces for tool arguments and responses.

### 3. Runtime Tool Validation

Add runtime validation to ensure all tools receive properly formatted arguments and return properly formatted responses.

### 4. Additional LLM Post-Processing

Implement post-processing logic to enforce that the final output is always a `final_answer` tool call, even if the LLM doesn't follow instructions perfectly.

## Conclusion

By enforcing the `final_answer` workflow, we've standardized how agents complete their tasks, improving type safety, code consistency, and predictability of agent behavior. However, working with LLMs requires robust prompting strategies and fallback mechanisms to handle cases where the model doesn't perfectly follow instructions.

_Agent: default

[1] Analyzing current ReAct system and identifying Zod integration opportunities
[2] Found template system - checking how tools are formatted for prompts
[3] FOUND THE ROOT CAUSE: getCatalog() only shows name+description, missing Zod schema parameter details
[4] Created enhanced schema formatter and updated tool registry - now testing
[5] SUCCESS! Enhanced schema working - agent correctly used parameters. Now documenting the improvement
